Welcome to My GitHub!

My name is Louan Bardou and I'm a data scientist currently enrolled at Ecole Polytechnique until 2027. Formerly I have completed a French Engineering Degree at UTC where I specialised into material engineering. I discovered my passion for Data Sciences during my Internship at SELEGO, where I worked as an Engineering Product Manager. During those 6 months I worked in SQL

My goal is to develop general-purpose representations that enable autonomous systems to learn from diverse inputs and improve through self-supervision.

What I explore:

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): Enabling systems to learn from raw, unlabeled data
Contrastive Learning: Understanding abstract concepts and complex relationships
Multimodal Learning: Learning cross-domain representations
Causal Reasoning: Integrating a more reliable representation of the world into systems

I believe these systems must be designed with responsibility and purpose â€” not only to advance capabilities, but to ensure they serve the long-term benefit of humanity.

Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I’m Louan Bardou.
I mainly code in Python. Whenever I use AI models or external code, I make sure to document them clearly in my projects. Most of my repositories are deep dives in Python where I explore hands-on ideas.

Background

- École Polytechnique (2025–2027) → Currently pursuing studies in Data Science & AI.
- Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC) → Completed a French Engineering Degree in Materials Engineering.

At UTC I specialized in mechanical enginnering and materials modeling, which gave me strong problem-solving foundations.

My Transition to Data

- I discovered my passion for Data Science during my internship at SELEGO as an Engineering Product Manager.
- Worked daily with SQL and data pipelines.
- Used data-driven decision-making to guide engineering choices.
- Realized I enjoyed extracting insights from data more than working strictly in materials science.

This experience was the turning point that set me on my current path in Data Science & AI research.

My Path

I am now exploring the research direction of building general-purpose representations that enable autonomous systems to learn from diverse inputs and improve through self-supervision.

Current Research Interests

- Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): Learning from raw & unlabeled data.
- Contrastive Learning: Capturing abstract concepts and complex relationships.
- Multimodal Learning: Building cross-domain representations.
- Causal Reasoning: Moving toward reliable world models for AI.

Vision

For me, it’s not just about pushing technical capabilities beyond the current limits.
I believe AI systems needs to be designed with responsibility and purpose, to make sure they contribute to the long-term benefit of humanity.
